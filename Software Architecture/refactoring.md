## Refactorización

Code refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code – changing the factoring – without 
changing its external behavior. Refactoring improves nonfunctional attributes of the software. Advantages 
include improved code readability and reduced complexity to improve source code maintainability, and create 
a more expressive internal architecture or object model to improve extensibility.
