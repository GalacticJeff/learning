##Dise√±o de software

Software design is the process by which an agent creates a specification of a software artifact, 
intended to accomplish goals, using a set of primitive components and subject to constraints.

Software design may refer to either "all the activities involved in conceptualizing, framing, implementing, 
commissioning, and ultimately modifying complex systems" or "the activity following requirements specification 
and before programming, as ... [in] a stylized software engineering process."

Software design usually involves problem solving and planning a software solution. This includes both low-level 
component and algorithm design and high-level, architecture design.
